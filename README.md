## Feature

Ensure that you can run the Spring app.
Create a hello world route at /hello, and ensure that you can visit that route in your browser and see data come back.
Create a route that turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, I should be able to visit /capitalize/hello and get back the response HELLO, or I could visit /capitalize/this is Kinda Capitalized and get the response THIS IS KINDA CAPITALIZED.
Write a unit test for the capitalization functionality of that route.
Create a route that reverses the order of the words in a query parameter. For example, if I visit /reverse?sentence=Hello world, it should return world Hello.
Write a unit test for the word reversing functionality of the above route.
